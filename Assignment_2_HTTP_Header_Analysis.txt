**Assignment 2: Analyzing HTTP Headers - Report**

**Objective:**
To analyze HTTP headers using a network packet sniffer (Wireshark) and identify request/response headers, MIME types, and HTTP status codes.

**Tools Used:**
- Wireshark (Version: 4.x)
- Chrome browser for HTTP GET and POST requests

---

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**1. Launching Wireshark:**
- Opened Wireshark and selected the active network interface.
- Started capture and filtered traffic using: `http`.

**2. Capturing HTTP GET Request:**
- Opened Chrome and visited `http://example.com`.
- Wireshark captured the request.

**3. Capturing HTTP POST Request:**
- Used an HTML form to send a POST request to a local PHP file.
- Wireshark captured the POST request.

**4. Identifying HTTP Headers:**

**Request Headers (GET and POST):**
- Host
- User-Agent
- Accept
- Content-Type (POST only)
- Content-Length (POST only)

**Response Headers:**
- Server
- Date
- Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
- Content-Length

**5. MIME Type of the Response:**
- The MIME type seen in response: `text/html`

**6. HTTP Status Code and Explanation:**
- Status: `200 OK` — Request was successful.
- Status: `404 Not Found` — Resource was not found (captured by visiting a wrong URL intentionally).

---

**Conclusion:**
Using Wireshark, we successfully captured and analyzed HTTP GET and POST requests. We identified key headers, MIME types, and HTTP response codes, enhancing our understanding of web communication protocols.
